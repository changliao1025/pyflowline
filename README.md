PyFlowline: a mesh-independent river network generator for hydrologic models. 

PyFlowline is mesh independent, meaning you can apply it to both structured 

1. traditional rectangle mesh 
2. latitude-longitude 
3. hexagon
4. dggs ([dggrid](https://github.com/sahrk/DGGRID))

and unstructured mesh systems 

1. Model for Prediction Across Scales mesh ([MPAS](https://github.com/MPAS-Dev))
2. Triangulated Irregular Network (TIN) mesh

This package generates the mesh cell-based conceptual river networks using the following steps:

1. `Flowline simplification`: PyFlowline checks the vector dataset and corrects undesired flowlines, such as braided rivers.
2. `Mesh generation`: PyFlowline generates structured meshes (e.g., rectangle, hexagon) or imports user-provided unstructured meshes into the PyFlowline-compatible GEOJSON format.
3. `Topological relationship reconstruction`: PyFlowline reconstructs the topological relationship using the mesh and flowline intersections.


### Dependency

PyFlowline depends on the following packages

1. `numpy`
2. `gdal`
3. `netCDF4`
4. `shapely`

PyFlowline also has three optional dependency packages

1. `cython` for performance 
2. `matplotlin` for visualization
3. `cartopy` for visulization
4. `simplekml` for Google Earth KML support

### Quickstart

Please refer to the [quickstart documentation](https://pyflowline.readthedocs.io/en/latest/quickstart.html) for details on how to get started using the PyFlowline package.

### Installation

Please refer to the [official documentation](https://pyflowline.readthedocs.io/) for details on how to install the PyFlowline package.

### Application

We provide several examples in the `examples` folder to demonstrate the model capability. We also recommend starting with the `notebooks/mpas_example.ipynb` notebook, after following the Quickstart and Installation instructions.
