# Examples

This directory contains several different example files that demonstrate how to use the PyFlowline software.

- create_model_configuration.py: This example creates a configuration file. You can edit this configuration and then use it for the actual simulation such as in the run_simulation.py scripts.

- run_simulation_<meshtype>.py: These examples demonstrate how to read a configuration file and use the generated PyFlowline object to run a simulation for four types of meshes.
